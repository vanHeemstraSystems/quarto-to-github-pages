# 300 - Building Our Application

Three alternative methods:

1) Render to docs: Not preferred as generated pages will be checked into Git ```main``` branch.

2) Publish Command: Not preferred, as although no generated pages will be checked into Git ```main``` branch, but ```gh-pages``` branch instead, there is still a manual step required for publishing.

3) GitHub Action: Preferred as GitHub Actions allow a fully-automated process to publish on every commit to the ```main``` branch.
