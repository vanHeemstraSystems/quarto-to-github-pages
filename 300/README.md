# 300 - Building Our Application

Three alternative methods:

1) Render to docs: Not preferred as generated pages will be checked into Git ```main``` branch.

2) Publish Command: Preferred, as no generated pages will be checked into Git ```main``` branch, but ```gh-pages``` branch instead.

3) GitHub Action: Not preferred as GitHub Actions come at a cost.
