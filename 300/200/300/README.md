# 300 - Publishing

Once you have configured the source branch and updated your ```.gitignore```, navigate to the directory where your project / git repository is located, make sure you are not on the ```gh-pages``` branch, and execute the ```quarto publish``` command for GitHub Pages:

```
$ quarto publish gh-pages
```

The publish command will confirm that you want to publish, render your content, copy the output to a special ```gh-pages``` branch, push that branch to GitHub, and then open a browser to view your site once it is deployed.
